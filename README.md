Node-RED IBM Cloud Starter Application
====================================

### Customising Node-RED

This repository is here to be cloned, modified and re-used to allow anyone create
their own Node-RED based application that can be quickly deployed to IBM Cloud.

The default flows are stored in the `defaults` directory in the file called `flow.json`.
When the application is first started, this flow is copied to the attached Cloudant
instance. When a change is deployed from the editor, the version in cloudant will
be updated - not this file.

The web content you get when you go to the application's URL is stored under the
`public` directory.

Additional nodes can be added to the `package.json` file and all other Node-RED
configuration settings can be set in `bluemix-settings.js`.

If you do clone this repository, make sure you update this `README.md` file to point
the `Deploy to IBM Cloud` button at your repository.

If you want to change the name of the Cloudant instance that gets created, the memory
allocated to the application or other deploy-time options, have a look in `manifest.yml`.

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be used to configure the application:

 - `NODE_RED_STORAGE_NAME` - the Cloudant service name as exposed in `VCAP_SERVICES`
 - `NODE_RED_STORAGE_DB_NAME` - the name of the database to use on Cloudant
 - `NODE_RED_STORAGE_APP_NAME` - the prefix used in document names, allowing multiple instances
    to share the same database.
 - `NODE_RED_USERNAME`, `NODE_RED_PASSWORD` - if set, used to secure the editor
 - `NODE_RED_GUEST_ACCESS` - if the editor is secured, this will allow anonymous,
    read-only access
 - `NODE_RED_USE_APPMETRICS` - enables the appmetrics dashboard
